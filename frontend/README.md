> In this repository there is the frontend of the Know Weather project.

The frontend is responsible for displaying data from the backend.

The frontend was deployed to firebase hosting, which you can access [here](https://know-weather.web.app/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Development server

### Prequisites

To get started with developing on frontend, you'll need to install dependencies. First of all you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. The version used in this project was 15.6.0. To install all dependencies run `npm install`.

### Building

If everything is set up correctly, running `npm run build` will compile the typescript fonts.

### Watching

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
