# Backend

In this repository there is the backend of the Know Weather project.

The backend was deployed on the heroku platform, using a free plan.

## Development server

First, install all Node-related dependencies with `npm install`. After that, copy over `.template.env` to `.env` and adjust all required values (surrounded by `""`).

If everything is set up correctly, running `npm run build` will compile the typescript fonts. After that, just use `npm start` to start the api with the specified configuration values.

If you are developing, you can use `npm run dev` to automatically compile typescript as you work.
